After writing each code, please check whether your code strictly complies with the following code style requirements:

# Code Styles

- When providing chat responses, please use Simplified Chinese. For code output, documents, and any in-code or document comments, please use American English
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT "BEST PRACTICES" OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
- Always use underscores in variable naming style instead of the popular camel case naming style
- Always use `type` instead of `interface`
- Don't add type annotations if the type can be inferred automatically
- Don’t create new variables, named handlers, or type aliases unless you need to use them in multiple places
- Use object and array destructors to extract elements whenever possible
- Unless it is absolutely necessary, do not use `let`, use `const` instead
- Keep the code concise and extensible
- Use functional programming style appropriately
- Do not mechanically copy other UI styles: when writing UI code, please carefully understand the existing UI code and follow the existing UI style
- Don’t use margins unless absolutely necessary, use padding instead
