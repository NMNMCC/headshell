1. Deep Analysis Before Imitation:
Don't just copy the surface-level structure
Carefully examine how existing components handle their styles, especially the relationship between parent and child elements
Look for patterns in how other components solve similar problems

2. Understanding Component Hierarchy:
Pay attention to which element (parent or child) should bear the styling responsibility
In this case, we learned that the form element should handle the padding, not the container
This pattern likely exists for a reason in the codebase

3. Pattern Recognition:
When multiple components in the same directory share similar patterns, it's likely intentional
The consistent use of p-2 on form elements across Tag, Move, and Rename wasn't a coincidence
Such patterns often reflect architectural decisions or design principles

4. Avoiding Assumptions:
Don't assume that adding more styling will improve the component
Sometimes, less is more, and the existing patterns have been carefully considered
The simpler solution (single p-2 on form) was the correct one
